#### Optimization

0. Try to see if sticking footer on bottom would fix lots of stuff.
1. Change the color to something more readable for the colored-gender blocks
2. Find better image hosting to be able to host the image and embed the link into the server.js.
3. re-organize Cats page to change display on smaller screens
4. Home page, change the "Adopt" button width. Full width looks better on mobile view.
5. Adjust the main size so that the footer won't have white spacing under it on smaller screen.
6. Apply the hover animation on button on CatDetails just like the button on Home
7. Cats page, add spacing coz footer is overlapping
8. Code the Sad Path - Error handling (Scrimba SearchParams # 23)
